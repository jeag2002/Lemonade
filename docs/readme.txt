The ex singer of Milli Vanilli, Rob Pilatus, decided to open a travel agency in his home town. He needs a application to keep
track of his clients and the trips they perform.
The application is almost finished, but there are some new requirements to implement specified in the docs/issues.txt file.

The application uses postgresql as db engine and the dump file  can be found at sql/vanillitravels-dump.sql
